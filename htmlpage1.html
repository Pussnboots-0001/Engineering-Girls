        <center><font size="+1" face="roboto">Did you know that typical sanitary pads are made from 90% plastic.<br> 
            And its not only the plastic content which is a concern, but also the chemical content.<br> 
            There are millions of chemicals that are required to produce these.<br> 
            These chemicals not only harm the envioronment but also affect the intimate areas.<br>
            Environmental impact caused by sanitary waste is one of the significant topics in discussions today.<br> 
            A plastic, industrially manufactured, disposable sanitary pad requires about 500–800 years to decompose.<br> 
            Thousands of tons of disposable sanitary waste is generated every month all over the world.<br>

432 million pads/sanitary napkins are generated in India annually, the potential to cover landfills spread over 24 hectares.<br>

This is a ridiculous amount of pollution which is hazardous with toxic chemicals leaching the soil, strong and harsh odours emitted by the waste disposed of in landfills or buried in the soil.<br>

This waste is toxic and hazardous to human health as well. Most of the chemicals from these pads reaching the soil causes groundwater pollution, loss of soil fertility. Disposal of this sanitary waste is also a big question mark.<br>

            </font></center>
            <center>
                <p>Single-use menstrual products such as tampons and pads are a significant contributor globally to single-use plastic waste.<br>
                    They can contain up to 90% plastic and are often individually wrapped.<br>
                    The varied composition of single-use menstrual products, together with the presence of organic matter after use, makes their recycling technically and economically expensive. <br>
                    As a result, the vast majority of these products are landfilled or incinerated.<br>

            <p>There’s more to sustainable menstruation products than them just being good for the environment.<br>
                 It is better and safe for your body and health in comparison to any other disposable product.<br> 
                 The reason for this is simple—sustainable period products are made of materials that are supposedly safe for your body.<br> 
               Disposable period products, which we have been using for years, are known to contain upto 90% plastic and chemicals which cause skin infections—like vaginal, vulva, urinary, reproductive tract—and even cancer.<br> 
               But then, if not the usual sanitary pads, what should a menstruator use? That’s where sustainable menstruation comes in.<br>

            <p>
                Sustainable menstruation refers to the use of alternative products during one’s menstrual cycle for the benefit of the body and earth.<br>
                Sustainable menstruation is being mindful of the negative effects disposable sanitary products have on our environment in efforts to reduce the plastic waste ending up in our oceans or landfills.<br>
                This movement also focuses on the access to sustainable menstruation products all people who menstruate should have. Many who have a difficult time purchasing healthy menstrual products look at sustainable menstrual products as a healthier and cheaper product to use.<br>

            <p>
                  Plastic Menstrual products generate more than 200,000 tonnes of waste per year. <br>
                  Most menstrual hygiene products are made up of plastic and are non-biodegradable, taking approximately 500 to 800 years to decompose. <br>
                  Menstrual hygiene products such as pads and tampons usually contain dangerous chemicals, like pesticide residues, bleach, and phthalates that cause harm to the body.<br>

    <center><font size="+2">A menstrual cup is a menstrual hygiene device. it's purpose is to collect menstrual blood.
    menstrual cups are usually made of flexible medicle grade sillicone, latex, or a thermoplastic isomer.
    there are shaped like a bell with a stem or a ring.
    
    A single cup lasts over 10 years. It saves you from buying products for each cycle. It’s easy to clean and maintain during and in between cycles. They’re made from medical grade silicone, an inert material, which is why they are safe for internal use. 
    Downside: In areas where clean running water is not available all day, this may not be the best option. Some menstruators may also find it difficult or painful to use owing to anxiety of inserting, vulvodynia, vaginismus, etc.

<center><font size="+2">Cloth menstrual pads are worn in the underwear to collect menstrual fluid (blood from uterine lining). 
    They are a type of reusable menstrual hygiene product, and are an alternative to disposable sanitary napkins or to menstrual cups. Because they can be reused, they are generally less expensive than disposable pads over time, and reduce the amount of waste produced.
    This is very close to using disposable pads we are already accustomed to using, except they’re made from pure cotton cloth. The idea of using cloth to absorb period blood is age old, but the cloth used must be clean and of a certain quality to be safe for use. Cloth pads ensure that only safe quality cloth is used as a product. One pad (depending on the brand) can last upto five years.

    Downside: These have to be washed after each use just how you would wash clothes/bed sheets that get stained with blood and have to be dried adequately, which could be time consuming. Additionally, one must be careful to change these timely to avoid accumulation of moisture which can cause infections.
